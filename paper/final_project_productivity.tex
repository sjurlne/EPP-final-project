\begin{abstract}
    This paper presents a productivity analysis framework for various sectors in a country's 
    economy using web scraping techniques. The analysis focuses on Labour Productivity and 
    Total Factor Productivity. The productivity measure standards of the Statistical Bureau 
    of Norway are used as a reference. The paper presents changes in productivity over time 
    and levelled graphs for the 10 largest sectors. The resulting framework can provide 
    insights into productivity and help policymakers and business leaders optimize productivity 
    across the economy.

\section{Introduction} % (fold)
\label{sec:introduction}

The following paper presents a project conducted as part of the Effective Programming Practices 
course at the University of Bonn. The aim of the project is to produce a framework for 
productivity analysis across various sectors of a country's economy. To achieve this goal, the 
project utilizes web scraping techniques to collect and analyze data from relevant sources. The
 paper will focus on two different measures of productivity: Labour Productivity and Total 
 Factor Productivity. Labour Productivity is a measure of output per hour worked, while Total 
 Factor Productivity is a measure of the overall efficiency of production, taking into account 
 all factors of production, such as labor, capital, and technology. The resulting framework 
 will provide insights into the productivity of different sectors.

The productivity measure standards of the Statistical Bureau of Norway will be used as a 
reference for how productivity is calculated \cite{ssb_norway}. The paper will first present 
changes in productivity over time, followed by levelled graphs for the 10 largest sectors.

Web scraping techniques can be an effective solution to overcome challenges at governmental statistical 
websites, where users might face difficulty in selecting variables and sectors required for analysis. By 
utilizing web scraping techniques, users can automate the process of navigating statistical websites, 
collecting and extracting the required data from a variety of sources, and ultimately generating useful
insights. Through web scraping, the process of selecting variables and sectors can be automated, 
allowing users to quickly and easily extract the required data, without having to manually search for 
specific data points. Furthermore, web scraping can help overcome challenges related to the organization 
of statistical websites, which can often be complex and difficult to navigate. Overall, web scraping provides 
an efficient and reliable method of extracting data from statistical websites, enabling users to overcome 
the challenges associated with traditional data collection methods.
